/*
 * Summary: This code defines a 'Product' class with three attributes: id, name,
 * and price. It uses a constructor to initialize these values. The main logic
 * is in the static method 'countProducts', which filters and counts products
 * with a price less than 30,000 using Java Streams. The 'filter' method with a
 * lambda expression checks each product's price, and the 'count' method
 * computes how many products meet the criteria. Understanding streams and
 * lambda expressions was new. Using them simplified the logic but initially
 * required some practice to get familiar with how they work. Iâ€™ll make sure to
 * use streams and lambdas more often in the future for filtering and processing
 * collections.
